Bank customers receive many recommendations while many others rarely see any, resulting in an uneven customer experience.
Banks needs to transform their approach from a product-centric focus to a more customer-centric view.
A customer-centric cross-sell approach is built on three principles:
Better customer insight
Analytics to translate data into intelligent product offers
Optimizing business processes

The “Next Best Offer” strategy starts with knowledge about the individual customer so that you know which product is the right thing to offer to that customer. If customer level data is analyzed well and correct approach to offer products is taken, benefits customers to get the financial products they want, and the bank to develop a deeper relationship with the customer. This means that product offerings are tailored for each customer, rather than single products being marketed through large scale and costly outbound campaigns.
As a Next Best Action solution adds value to every customer decision, its bottom line contribution goes up with both the number of interactions and their complexity.
The NBA model provides a decision engine that guides each inbound and outbound customer action and communication for every channel and line of business.
